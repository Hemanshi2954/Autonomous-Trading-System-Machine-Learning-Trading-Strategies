## **Project Overview**

This project leverages advanced **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)** strategies to forecast **EURUSD trading trends** and execute **live automated trading orders** with **email notifications** in USD.

At its core, the project features:
- An **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model for **time series forecasting**.
- Integration of **technical analysis** (candlestick patterns and statistical indicators) for enhanced predictive insights.
- Additional machine learning models like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **neural networks (NN)** for support/resistance level detection.

Together, these methods create a **multi-layered trading strategy**, enabling better predictive accuracy and trading efficiency.
